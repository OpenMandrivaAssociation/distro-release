# These are optional password-requirements that a distro can enforce
# on the user. The values given in this sample file disable each check,
# as if the check was not listed at all.
#
# Checks may be listed multiple times; each is checked separately,
# and no effort is done to ensure that the checks are consistent
# (e.g. specifying a maximum length less than the minimum length
# will annoy users).
#
# (additional checks may be implemented in UsersPage.cpp)

# You can control the visibility of the 'strong passwords' checkbox here.
# Possible values are: 
#  - true to show or 
#  - false to hide  (default)
# the checkbox. This checkbox allows the user to choose to disable
# password-strength-checks. By default the box is **hidden**, so
# that you have to pick a password that satisfies the checks.

# You can control the initial state for the 'strong passwords' checkbox here.
# Possible values are: 
#  - true to uncheck or

# passwords, in order to **allow** weak ones by default, the box needs
# to be unchecked.

#   - *Hostnamed*, to use systemd hostnamed(1) over DBus
# The default is *EtcFile*.
