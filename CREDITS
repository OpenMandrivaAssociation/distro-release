# first field ("Translators") is translatable, it is the main section
# second field is the subsection for language, it is half translatable,
# and half non translatable, eg: "French (Français)", "French (%s)"
# is translatable, but "Français" is not; so when displaying under
# Spanish locale it would look like "Francés (Français)" and
# under Russian locale "Француска (Français)"
# last field is the translator name (and possibly email), it is not
# translatable.
# maybe also the language section may be made into a clickable
# link to the url of the translation status page?
