   The OpenMandriva Lx teams are pleased to announce the availability of
   the release 3!

   Detailed below are some of the advances that the distribution has
   incorporated since OpenMandriva Lx 2014.1. Apart from the enhancements
   233 bug have been resolved since the 2014 release.

Available Media

   This release is available as a live media DVD, downloadable in ISO
   format. These are available on our downloads page.

   Live media means you're able to run OpenMandriva Lx straight from a DVD
   or memory stick (See Below) and try it before installing it. You may
   also install the system to hard disk either from the running live image
   or from the boot manager.

Important Note

   The live media currently comes with no predefault mirrors. This means
   that there are currently no mirrors accessible to urpmi. The mirror
   list is updated/refreshed periodically.

   It may be that you have installed this release very early, so the
   mirrorlist may not yet be due for update - so urpmi will refuse to
   work. There are two ways to correct this problem:
    1. Wait a few hours until the mirror list is due for an update.
    2. Force a refresh by running su -c 'rm -f
       /var/cache/urpmi/mirrors.cache', entering the root (administrator)
       password when prompted.

Recommended Hardware

   OpenMandriva Lx 3 requires at least 1 GB of memory (min 640MB), at
   least 10 GB of hard drive space (see below for known issues with
   partitioning), and for best compositing performance a suitable
   accelerated 3D graphics card.

   If you wish to run the live distribution (the option to Start
   OpenMandriva 3 at the CD boot screen), you must have at minimum 1.5 GB
   of memory. At least 2 GB of memory is recommended for optimal
   performance.

   Releases are available for i586 and x86_64 architectures. ARM
   architectures are not available for this release.

Virtual Machines

   The same hardware requirements apply when running in virtual machines.

   For VirtualBox, however, you must ALWAYS have at least 1536 MB of
   memory or OpenMandriva Lx will fail to boot. Please ensure that
   VirtualBox is configured with "Enable PAE/NX" This option can be found
   under the System>Processor tab.
   Also for VirtualBox you must install to a fresh VM, as trying to
   install to an existing one may fail. This recent problem is being
   investigated.

   Note that if you use qemu, you may need to select an alternative
   graphics driver other than your distribution default or you will boot
   to a black screen.

EFI Support

   This release of OpenMandriva Lx supports booting and installation
   support for [77]UEFI booting. Testing for this has been limited and so
   EFI machines may not boot from the iso in EFI mode. Where it is seen
   you should be able to boot and install OpenMandriva LX on [78]UEFI
   machines.

   Note that secure boot is NOT supported.

   If you are installing beside Windows8 or similar EFI booted OS as a
   precaustion please ensure that you have recovery disks and you have
   backed any important data. Our testing has been limited in this area
   but successful installs have been performed with no issues. We would
   welcome feedback in this area.

EFI Partitioniong

   If you wish to to perform an EFI install on an existing MBR disk it
   will be necessary to convert the disks partition table to the newer GPT
   partitioning scheme. To do this you need to use the gdisk tool. A
   typical invocation would be 'gdisk /dev/sda'; the existing partition
   table wil converted in memory to the GPT scheme. Warnings will be
   issued about potential data loss, the disk will not be altered until
   you write the partition table by pressing "w"

   There may be occasions where the converstion cannot be performed, this
   will usually be dure to insufficient space at the beginning or end of
   the disk to write the partition tables. It may be necessary to delete
   or resize a partition to create the needed space. gparted is your
   friend in these circumstances.

   There is still a need to create an efi partition to contain the boot
   equiment and this must be created while running the installer. When the
   installer reaches the partitioniong stage the / (root) partition should
   be removed and a small (254mB) fat32 partition created at the start of
   the drive. This partition must be manually formatted and using the
   "TYPE" clickbutton labelled with a partition code of EF00. If you fail
   to observe these steps installation of the bootloader wil fail.
   Subsequently partition the disk in the normal way. When installing the
   the bootloader the entry in the text box labelled Bootloader-id should
   be "openmandriva" This will be the value that appears in your machines
   boot manager. Please share your experiences on the forums so that we
   may improve this aspect of the installation.

Booting from USB

   It is also possible to boot this release from a USB storage device. To
   transfer the live/installation you may use the ROSA Image Writer
   available from our repos: Please do not use other usb- writing tools as
   some Windows tools truncate the volume name. This breeaks the boot
   process.
urpmi rosa-imagewriter

   Or, if you do not have OpenMandriva Lx:
   [79]Windows (32-bit)
   [80]Linux x86 (32 bit)
   [81]Linux x86_64 (64 bit)
   [82]Mac OS

   At least 2GB of flash drive capacity is recommended. Persistent storage
   is not necessary. Note that this will erase everything on your USB!

via dd

   You may alternatively dd the image to your USB stick:
dd if=<iso_name> of=<usb_drive> bs=4M

   Replace <iso_name> with the path to the ISO and <usb_drive> with the
   device node of the USB drive, i.e. /dev/sdb.

New Features and Major Changes

   OpenMandriva Lx 3 is a new release.

LLVM/clang

   OpenMandriva decided to give a go for a switch to LLVM/clang as a
   default compiler, and finally has replaced GCC. Over 90% of packages
   are rebuilded with LLVM/clang in our main repository.

   Benefits for end user:
     * Fast compiles and Low Memory Use
     * Expressive Diagnostics
     * GCC Compatibility
     * Better object code generation compared to others
     * Object code is optimized for its size

   More infor can be found [83]here.

Kernel

   A new Kernel 3.18.11 nrJQL – a powerful variant of the 3.18.11 kernel
   that has been configured with desktop system performance,
   responsiveness, and realtime capabilities, in mind.
   The new NRJ mode adds CPU and RCU full Preemption and Boost mode, the
   QL mode adds patchsets which combine to provide further optimisations,
   including BFS CPU task scheduler, BFQ disk I/O scheduler, UKSM memory
   management, TOI for suspension and hibernation.
   This kernel version is enabled with kernel keys necessary to use the
   “EDID ovverride” feature, with this we should be able to override an
   incorrect screen EDID with boot time options, we have included EDIDBINS
   in the ISOs, a package containing 5 basic firmwares for the most common
   resolutions so that users may force different resolutions than the ones
   detected automatically by X.
   The CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT key allows loading of a customised acpi
   table. Details will be found on our Wiki in the kernel pages.
   Highlight:
   HT/SMT NICE feature added and enabled by default for a better
   responsiveness and realtime behaviour on all PC with HT (Hyper-Thread),
   improving performance of foreground applications at the expense of
   background ones.
   Your desktop / gui / applications will remain fast even if you run
   folding@home, mprime, seti@home etc.
   A more effective and precise control on the nice levels of server apps
   for its proper balancing and tuneups.
   Please, see: [84]https://wiki.openmandriva.org/en/Kernel for more
   information.

Desktop

   The oma-welcome oma-welcome, or Welcome to OpenMandriva Lx has been
   updated to reflect the new version. This application introduces users
   to OpenMandriva Lx and shows them some of the features we have, as well
   as providing quick links to common tasks such as updating, installing
   new software, and configuring a desktop.

Xorg

   We've upgraded Xorg to version 1.17.1, and Mesa to 10.5.3, which brings
   the latest free drivers for the best performance. A Compose cache is
   now incorporated which speeds up application startup time and reduces
   memory usage especially in locales with large Compose tables (e.g. all
   UTF-8 locales).

   We recommend that users change the composite manager in KDE from
   XRender to OpenGL mode. This gives transparency the proper blur effect.
   This also allows our theme and it's decorations to be shown at their
   best.

KDE 4.14.3

   We've upgraded to the latest and greatest version of the KDE desktop.
   If you don't know what KDE is, [85]learn more at their website.

   We've switched our default menu launcher to Homerun kicker. To learn
   more about Homerun, [86]check out its features page.

   The network management, media centre, and mobile device support has
   also been updated.

KF 5.x

   We are working to bring fully working KDE Framwork 5.x as our new
   default desktop, replacing KDE 4.x.

SDDM

   SDDM is new and lightweight displaymanager, written in Qt5 with QML and
   provides new features and benefits to enduser, compared to KDM.

LXQt 0.9.0

   We have prepared LXQt for our alpha release. LXQt is a lightweight
   desktop fully written in Qt5.

   By default SDDM is used as display manager.

xfce4 4.12.0

   xfce4 is very lightweight environment based on GTK+2.0 and GTK+3.0,
   featuring speed, low request on resources combined with great look.

Wayland

   We are working on many new and interesting shells using new display
   technology based on Wayland. Currently planned are:
     * hawaii
     * papyros-os
     * orbital

   Currently only Weston is working out of box.

LibreOffice 4.3.5

   The latest LibreOffice featuring much faster load times and many bug
   fixes.

Firefox 37.0.1

   The latest firefox with it's new graphical interface and all the latest
   features.

   You may wish to suspend desktop effects when Firefox is in full screen
   mode, as it speeds up scrolling.

Java 7-8

   The OpenMandriva Java stack has been entirely rebuilt to version 7 and
   is completely functional.

   We currently provide Eclipse Kepler by default.

Printing

   Improved support for printing, with an emphasis on the latest HP
   printers.

Sound

   ALSA is updated to version 1.0.29

   Pulseaudio version is 6.0, you can find more infomation about features
   [87]here.

Cloud service

   We added support for owncloud.org via mirall package.

systemd

   Default init system is systemd with version 219. By default are
   enabled;
     * systemd-networkd
     * systemd-timedated
     * systemd-timesyncd
     * systemd-resolved

LCMS

   We have updated our LCMS to version 2.x, also all software which was
   dependant on older library has been rebuilded to meet new one.

libarchive

   We have decided to make better use of [88]libarchive, and starting from
   this release by default we use:
     * bsdtar as a default tar program
     * bsdcpio as a default cpio program

   Detailed features and benefits can be found [89]here.

Perl

   Perl base package has been updated to 5.20.2 version. All perl related
   software in main repository has been rebuilded to meet new version.

Python

   Python has been updated to 3.4.3 version and starting from now it
   became default python interpreter over python 2.x.

ISO build tools

   Previously livecd-tools were used to build OpenMandriva ISO images. Due
   to code complication and its limits, we moved to build own ISO image
   build tool.

   [90]omdv-build-tool is written as a bash shell script, which works out
   of box on ABF.io and in userland.

Upgrading to 3

   Upgrading between releases always has the potential to cause some
   problems. Upgrading is supported and we do test upgrades, but due to
   the huge range of packages and hardware configurations that are
   possible, the upgrade may cause unexpected problems. Therefore we
   recommend that you always perform fully backup your system prior to any
   upgrading attempt, since there can be a chance for a loss of data. In
   particular be aware that upgrading between MDV-based packages and
   OMV-based packages may be the most problematic and should be avoided if
   possible.

   We hope that upgrading between OpenMandriva Lx releases will become
   less problematic in the near future.

Upgrading from previous OpenMandriva Lx Releases

   If you do NOT receive an upgrade notification from the Online Update
   applet, you may have to update your system.

   If mdkapplet crashes trying to upgrade, you may have to update the
   packages on your system first.

   If you still do not receive a notification (we may not have pushed it
   to all systems) or wish to do a manual upgrade, you may step through
   the following procedure.

   As root, run the following commands:
urpmi.removemedia -a

urpmi.addmedia --distrib --mirrorlist 'http://downloads.openmandriva.org/mirrors
/openmandriva.2015.0.ARCH.list'

   Substitute ARCH with your architecture, e.g. i586 or x86_64.

   Then run the following commands:
urpmi --auto --auto-select --replacefiles 2>&1 | tee /root/upgrade.log

   Reboot when completed. The upgrade log is stored in /root/upgrade.log.

Upgrading from 2011.0

   Please upgrade to 2013.0 first by following the procedures outlined in
   the [91]2013.0 release notes before upgrading to 3.

Changes to Hardware Support

Graphics Support

   Graphics support has improved with the latest drivers however there are
   still issues with some hardware.

NVIDIA Graphics Cards

   NVidia graphics cards are all currently supported by the XFDrake, the
   DrakX video configuration tool. In some cases it may be necessary to
   install older drivers using the command line. These drivers are
   available from the OpenMandriva repositories. The reverse engineered
   nouveau driver gives moderately good support for these older cards and
   for some dual-screen work(Publishing) it is actually better as it
   supports screen rotation on a second monitor which is useful for
   monitors with rotatable screens.

ATI Graphics Cards

   The latest ATI graphics cards are supported; however, we have not had
   any concrete feedback about its usage. Your mileage may vary.

   If you are using Radeon HD7770 or if you experience a black screen at
   boot and you know that you have an ATI/AMD grahics card please add the
   command below to the grub2 cmdline:-
xorg.blacklist=ati

   To do this at when booting the iso press the "TAB" key; the kernel
   bootline will be displayed at the bottom of the screen, go to the end
   of it and add any options required there. Press enter to boot. If you
   need to enter a kernel parameter while boot an installed system the
   procedure is slightly different. At the boot screen press the "E" key
   and this will bring up the Grub editor. Search for the first line that
   begins with "linux" go to the end of it and add the option there. To
   boot press F10.

Intel Graphics Cards

   Intel graphics cards are supported with the latest kernel we have,
   including newer 4th generation Intel graphics cards.

Miscellaneous Graphic Cards .

   We have not had feedback from users. Should you have an unusual
   graphics card that is not performing as it should please file a bug at
   issues.openmandriva.org

Changes to Installation

Installer

   We are using [92]Calamares as our default installer.

   Calamares is an installer framework. By design it is very customizable,
   in order to satisfy a wide variety of needs and use cases.

   Calamares aims to be easy, usable, beautiful, pragmatic, inclusive and
   distribution-agnostic.

Unused Hardware & Language Removal

   This feature has been re-enabled. It prompts you to run it at first
   boot, and you may run it any time afterwards from the oma-welcome
   application (Welcome to OpenMandriva Lx).

Changes to the DrakX suite of tools

Boot Configuration

   We now default to using kcm-grub2 to control the boot loader.

Proprietary Drivers

   We now install proprietary drivers correctly.

Firewall

   We have deprecated drakfirewall in favour of firewall-config, which
   relies on firewalld.

   Service responsible for firewall is enabled by default.

Booting with systemd

   Systemd has now been moved into the initramfs and the result is
   super-fast booting. Switching runlevels has changed. Instead of adding
   the target runlevel, as before, there are now specific boot options.
   Namely, the following options must be appended to the kernel command
   line:
     * Rescue Mode: systemd.unit=rescue.target
     * Text Mode: systemd.unit=multi-user.target
     * Graphical Mode: systemd.unit=graphical.target

Desktop Environments

   Please note that only KDE is supported by OpenMandriva Lx at this time.
   LXDE, Unity, GNOME, XFCE, or any other desktop environment is not
   supported.

Media Sources

contrib

   contrib represents community maintained packages. These are not
   supported by the core OpenMandriva Lx team, and depend on package
   maintainers to update it.

restricted

   restricted contains libraries that aren't installed by default due to
   legal concerns. The usage of these packages vary by country -
   OpenMandriva Lx is not responsible for their usage! If you believe that
   their usage is unallowed in your country, please disable the restricted
   repositories.

Other Changes

Monitor EDID Loading

   The "EDID ovverride" feature is now available and allows a monitor with
   incorrect (or no) EDID to be enabled at kernel boot A package
   "edidbins" has been included in the ISOs which provided five binary
   files to support the most common resolutions. These may be called from
   the kernel command line at boot such that screen resolution may be
   force to that which the user desires. Obviously a facility like this
   should be used with care as it has the potential to damage your
   monitor. In order to enable one of the supplied edid's you need to add
   the following line to your kernel command line
   "drm_kms_helper.edid_firmware=edid/1280x1024.bin" obviously you can
   select your resolution from those supplied which are.

   1024x768 1280x1024 1600x1200 1680x1050 1920x1080

   As things currently stand these resolutions are available as soon as
   the root directory is mounted. If you want these resolutions for
   plymouth then you will need to incorporate the edid binary file in the
   initramfs. Dracut the image builder does not currently support this.
   The current approach would be to unpack the initramfs, add the
   necessary files and then repack.

Errata

   As with any release, there are still issues and bugs that may not have
   been resolved. This page documents those that may cause inconvenience
   and where possible details how they may be worked around.

Repository Tools

   Cuurently rpmdrake is broken it will be fixed soon by an update. You
   may still update your system by using "urpmi --auto-update" from the
   command line. If you wish to install a package use "urpmi <package
   name>"

Booting Live DVD/USB

   If you have a problem booting the live image with some hardware please
   report a bug detailing your hardware and any observations that you make
   if you are affected by this problem.
Partitioning with Small Disks

   When using the custom partitioning tool to divide up the hard disk/s be
   aware that there is a minimum size requirement a root partition that
   contains the /usr directory of at least 5.0Gb. If the partition is made
   smaller that this the partition manager will not function correctly.

   Due to the adoption of systemd the use of a separate /usr partition is
   no longer possible. It is still permissible to have a separate
   /usr/local partition.

   Workaround: If you receive an error message stating that the partition
   is smaller than the minimum requirement then do not try to resize it as
   this will fail; instead, use the auto-allocate function which will
   automatically create a partitioning scheme for you, which you may then
   delete or change to suit your own requirements. This will clear the
   error.

Local Network Sharing

   The firewall service, firewalld is now disabled by default, if required
   it may be re-enabled via the OMA Contol Centre under the system entry.

Parental Controls

   Parental Controls are currently non-functional.

   Workaround: None available at the moment.

Partitioning with Small Disks: Clearing the partitioner

   When using the custom partitioning tool to divide up the hard disk/s be
   aware that there is a minimum size requirement a root partition that
   contains the /usr directory of at least 5.0Gb. If the partition is made
   smaller that this the partition manager will not function correctly.
Due to the adoption of systemd the use of a separate /usr partition is [93]no lo
nger possible.
It is still permissible to have a separate /usr/local partition.

   Workaround: If you receive an error message stating that the partition
   is smaller than the minimum requirement then do not try to resize it as
   this will fail; instead, use the auto-allocate function which will
   automatically create a partitioning scheme for you, which you may then
   delete or change to suit your own requirements. This will clear the
   error.

wheel

   Please note that the first user created on the system is part of the
   wheel group, which allocates special privileges that are usually only
   allocated for the root user. Users in wheel can bypass certain password
   dialogues to change system settings.

   Workaround: This is intended behaviour. If you wish to disable this,
   remove users from the wheel group.

Black Screen at Boot

   There is an issue with systems that have two different graphics
   adapters but only one of them is operational. Typically this is a
   Nvidia GPU combined the either Intel or AMD/ATI. Due to the automated
   nature of driver selection in modern systems if the non-functional GPU
   is automatically selected then X will load the matching driver. Thus
   the working GPU never gets setup resulting in a black screen. We have
   recently added a new boot command line option to allow an Xorg driver
   to be blacklisted thus allowing the correct driver to be detected.

   To use this feature you must edit the grub2 command line. You can do
   this by selecting your desired boot option and then pressing TAB. To
   the end of the line add the following:-
xorg.blacklist=<driver to blacklist>

   To determine which driver needs to be blacklisted is probably best
   achieved by booting the system to a text mode and checking which driver
   has been loaded at boot time. A procedure for doing this is detailed
   below. In some circumstances this may not be possible and you will need
   to resort to your motherboard/Graphics card specifications or trial and
   error. It will be necessary to permanently add the line to the grub2
   command line that boots the installation. This is described below.

   There are other circumstances where a black screen may be encountered.
   For example if you wish to use the proprietary driver for your graphics
   adapter it may be necessary to inhibit the kernel mechanism that loads
   the free drivers. In these circumstances adding
nomodeset

   or
nokmsboot

   to the kernel command line will normally be enough to allow
   installation of the OS or running with the manufacturers drivers . If
   necessary the command may be added permanently by editing
   /etc/default/grub at the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT label and adding
   the required command. Then run update-grub2

   To boot to text mode:-

   1: Boot from the DVD/USB stick and at the grub selection screen select
   the livecd option and press TAB. Edit the grub command line by and add
   the command
"systemd.unit=multi-user.task nomodeset"

   to the end and boot the machine. This will bring you to a command
   prompt where you can login.

   2: Login as root and then type lsmod | less and observe the output.
   Look for the loaded graphics driver by finding the drm entry the
   graphics driver will be listed here. It will be typically nouveau,
   radeon or i915 (there may be others). The name used here will be the
   name to add to the xorg.blacklist= parameter

Backlight Issues

   There are some machines with Intel GPU's (Netbooks particularly) that
   may still give a black screen even with everything set up correctly;
   this is due to the screen backlight logic being inverted. This may be
   fixed by adding i915.invert_brightness=1 parameter to the boot command
   line. This may be needed in addition to the xorg.blacklist= parameter.

Boot to a dracut prompt

   If this happens all is not lost. This may be indicative of the lack of
   disk driver for your hardware. Dracut indicates that it has produced a
   bug report which you can copy to a memory stick and then attach to a
   bug report you will need to mount your memory stick. Assuming it is FAT
   formatted then plug it in and type 'dmesg' the device name of your
   memory stick should be visible it will be in the form /dev/sd<x> the
   bracketed x will vary depending on how many drives have been found on
   your machine if for example you have one other drive then the entry
   might read /dev/sdb. Create a new directory /mnt with 'mkdir /mnt' then
   type 'mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt' and the drive should be mounted.
   (Note the 1 added to the device name). You should then be able to copy
   files to your memory stick with 'cp <files> /mnt/' . Please take the
   trouble to report this type of problem as receiving these reports is
   the only way we can improve our distribution.

Contact, Bug Reporting, Discussion

   You are invited to discuss this release on our:
