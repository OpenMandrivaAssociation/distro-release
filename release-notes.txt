            * [88]9 Contact, Bug Reporting, Discussion
            * [89]10 Helping the Project

   The OpenMandriva Lx teams are pleased to announce the availability of
   the release 3.0!

   Detailed below are some of the advances that the distribution has
   incorporated since OpenMandriva Lx 2014.1. Apart from the enhancements
   233 bug have been resolved since the 2014 release.

Available Media

   This release is available as a live media DVD, downloadable in ISO
   format. These are available on our [90]downloads page.

   Live media means you are able to run OpenMandriva Lx straight from a
   DVD or memory stick (See Below) and try it before installing it. You
   may also install the system to hard disk either from the running live
   image or from the boot manager.

Recommended Hardware

   OpenMandriva Lx 3.0 requires at least 1.5 GB of memory (min 1GB), at
   least 10 GB of hard drive space (see below for known issues with
   partitioning).

   If you wish to run the live distribution (the option to Start
   OpenMandriva Lx at the CD boot screen), you must have at minimum 1.5 GB
   of memory. At least 2 GB of memory is recommended for optimal
   performance.

   Release is available for x86_64 architecture, The i586 and ARM
   architectures are being worked on, but are not yet available for this
   release.

   Important Note

   KDE Plasma Desktop requires a 3D graphics card that supports OpenGL 2.0
   or above

Virtual Machines

   The same hardware requirements apply when running in virtual machines.

   For VirtualBox, however, you must ALWAYS have at least 1536 MB of
   memory or OpenMandriva Lx will fail to boot. Please ensure that
   VirtualBox is configured with "Enable PAE/NX" This option can be found
   under the System>Processor tab.
   Also for VirtualBox you must install to a fresh VM, as trying to
   install to an existing one may fail. This recent problem is being
   investigated.

   Note that if you use qemu, you may need to select an alternative
   graphics driver other than your distribution default or you will boot
   to a black screen.

Installer and EFI Support

   This release of OpenMandriva Lx supports booting and installation with
   and without [91]UEFI.

   Best system installation experience is provided by [92]Calamares 2.3
   installer.

What is Calamares ?

   Calamares is an installer framework. By design it is very customizable,
   in order to satisfy a wide variety of needs and use cases. Calamares
   aims to be easy, usable, beautiful, pragmatic, inclusive and
   distribution-agnostic. Calamares includes an advanced partitioning
   feature, with support for both manual and automated partitioning
   operations. It is the first installer with an automated “Replace
   Partition” option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and
   over for distribution testing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   You should be able to boot and install OpenMandriva LX on [93]UEFI
   machines.

   Note that secure boot is NOT supported.

   If you are installing beside Windows8 or similar EFI booted OS as a
   precaution please ensure that you have recovery disks and you have
   backed up any important data. Our testing has been limited with this
   configuration but successful installs have been performed with no
   issues. We would welcome any feedback in this area.

   Please see the notes on partitioning [94]here and [95]here

EFI Partitioning

   If you wish to to perform an EFI install on an existing MBR disk it
   will be necessary to convert the disks partition table to the newer GPT
   partitioning scheme. To do this you need to use the gdisk tool. A
   typical invocation would be 'gdisk /dev/sda'; the existing partition
   table will be converted in memory to the GPT scheme. Warnings will be
   issued about potential data loss, the disk will not be altered until
   you write the partition table by pressing "w". You are advised to back
   up any important data.

   There may be occasions where the conversion cannot be performed, this
   will usually be due to insufficient space at the beginning or end of
   the disk to write the partition tables. It may be necessary to delete
   or resize a partition to create the needed space. gparted is your
   friend in these circumstances.

   There is still a need to create an efi partition to contain the boot
   equipment and this must be created while running the Calamares
   installer. When the installer reaches the partitioning stage the /
   (root) partition should be removed and a small (254mB) fat32 partition
   created at the start of the drive. If you fail to observe these steps
   installation of the boot loader will fail. Subsequently partition the
   disk in the normal way. Please share your experiences on the forums so
   that we may improve this aspect of the installation.

Booting from USB

   It is also possible to boot this release from a USB storage device. To
   transfer the live/installation you may use the ROSA Image Writer
   available from our repos: Please do not use other usb- writing tools as
   some Windows tools (e.g. Rufus) truncate the volume name. This breaks
   the boot process.
urpmi rosa-imagewriter

   Or, if you do not have OpenMandriva Lx:
   [96]Windows (32-bit)
   [97]Linux x86 (32 bit)
   [98]Linux x86_64 (64 bit)
   [99]Mac OS

   At least 2GB of flash drive capacity is recommended. Persistent storage
   is not necessary. Note that this will erase everything on your USB!

via dd

   You may alternatively dd the image to your USB stick:
dd if=<iso_name> of=<usb_drive> bs=4M

   Replace <iso_name> with the path to the ISO and <usb_drive> with the
   device node of the USB drive, i.e. /dev/sdb.

New Features and Major Changes

   OpenMandriva Lx 3.0 is a new release.

LLVM/clang

   OpenMandriva decided to give a go for a switch to LLVM/clang 3.8 as the
   default compiler, and finally has replaced GCC. Over 90% of packages in
   our main repository are built with LLVM/clang.

   Benefits for end user:
     * Fast compiles and Low Memory Use
     * Expressive Diagnostics
     * GCC Compatibility
     * Better object code generation compared to others
     * Object code is optimized for its size

   More information can be found [100]here.

Kernel

   OpenMandriva Lx uses the latest stable kernel, 4.6.4, by default.
   An even more current version, 4.7-rc3, is available in the repositories
   (kernel-desktop-rc-latest package) for people who want to test upcoming
   releases and/or who have hardware not yet supported in the stable
   release.
   OpenMandriva Lx also features kernel 4.1.18 nrJQL – a powerful variant
   of the 4.1.18 kernel that has been configured with desktop system
   performance, responsiveness, and realtime capabilities, in mind.
   The new NRJ mode adds CPU and RCU full Preemption and Boost mode, the
   QL mode adds patchsets which combine to provide further optimisations,
   including BFS CPU task scheduler, BFQ disk I/O scheduler, UKSM memory
   management, TOI for suspension and hibernation.
   This kernel version is enabled with kernel keys necessary to use the
   “EDID ovverride” feature, with this we should be able to override an
   incorrect screen EDID with boot time options, we have included EDIDBINS
   in the ISOs, a package containing 5 basic firmwares for the most common
   resolutions so that users may force different resolutions than the ones
   detected automatically by X.
   The CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT key allows loading of a customised acpi
   table. Details will be found on our Wiki in the kernel pages.
   Highlight:
   HT/SMT NICE feature added and enabled by default for a better
   responsiveness and realtime behaviour on all PC with HT (Hyper-Thread),
   improving performance of foreground applications at the expense of
   background ones.
   Your desktop / gui / applications will remain fast even if you run
   folding@home, mprime, seti@home etc.
   A more effective and precise control on the nice levels of server apps
   for its proper balancing and tuneups.
   Please, see: [101]https://wiki.openmandriva.org/en/Kernel for more
   information.

systemd

   Default init system is [102]systemd with version 230. By default are
   enabled:
     * systemd-networkd
     * systemd-timedated
     * systemd-timesyncd
     * systemd-resolved

Xorg

   We have upgraded Xorg to version 1.18.3, and Mesa to 12.0.1, which
   brings the latest free drivers for the best performance. A Compose
   cache is now incorporated which speeds up application startup time and
   reduces memory usage especially in locales with large Compose tables
   (e.g. all UTF-8 locales).

Wayland

   We are working on many new and interesting shells using new display
   technology based on [103]Wayland 1.10.0 version. Currently planned are:
     * [104]hawaii-desktop
     * [105]papyros-shell

   For now Weston and KDE Plasma 5 are working out of box. KDE Plasma 5
   running on wayland is still experimental and not recommended for daily
   use.

libinput

   All the input devices like keyboard, mouse, touchpad and others are now
   handled though [106]libinput 1.2.2 version library by default.

Desktop

   The oma-welcome, or Welcome to OpenMandriva Lx has been updated to
   reflect the new version. This application introduces users to
   OpenMandriva Lx and shows them some of the features we have, as well as
   providing quick links to common tasks such as updating, installing new
   software, and configuring a desktop.

KDE Plasma 5.6.5

   We have ve upgraded to the latest and greatest version of the KDE
   Plasma desktop. If you don't know what KDE Plasma is, [107]learn more
   at their website.
   KDE Frameworks are updated to [108]5.23.0 version.
   KDE Applications are updated to [109]16.04.2 version.
   We are using Plasma-discover as a main tool for updating distibution.
   Plasma-discover is a Qt5 frontend for PackageKit.
   Our distribution is running with Qt [110]5.6.1 version.
   Important notice!
   Plasma 5 heavily uses Qt5 OpenGL. This means a minimal system
   requirements is to have a graphics card that support OpenGL 2.0 or
   newer version.

KF 5.23.0

   We have implemented full KDE Framework that allows user to get all of
   benefits of Plasma 5 desktop.

Calligra Suite 2.9.11, Krita 3.0

   [111]Calligra Suite is a graphic art and office suite written in Qt4
   and supports KDE Plasma 5. (A port to Qt5 is currently in progress, but
   not yet included in the 3.0 release). It is possible to install whole
   calligra suite after installation is finished. [112]Krita, a raster
   graphics editor that is part of Calligra, has already been ported to
   Qt5 and is included in the install image.

SDDM

   SDDM is new and lightweight displaymanager, written in Qt5 with QML and
   provides new features and benefits to enduser, compared to KDM.

LXQt 0.10.0

   We have prepared LXQt for our alpha release. LXQt is a lightweight
   desktop fully written in Qt5.

   By default SDDM is used as display manager.

xfce4 4.12.0

   bug fixes.

Web browsing

Qupzilla 2.0.1

   [114]Qupzilla is a full featured web browser using Qt5WebEngine as a
   rendering engine. More information can be found [115]here.

   We encourage to give qupzilla a try as a new experience in web browsers
   world.

Firefox 47.0

   The latest [116]firefox with its new graphical interface and all the
   latest features.

   You may wish to suspend desktop effects when running Firefox is in full
   screen mode, as it speeds up scrolling.

Chromium 51.0.2704.79

   A [117]Chromium web browser is available to install it on running
   system either by using urpmi or discover or rpmdrake.
urpmi chromium-browser-stable

   If you wish to try an experimental version with newer features (but not
   quite the stability), you can also try
urpmi chromium-browser-dev

   The -stable and -dev versions can coexist on the same installation.

Java 8

   The OpenMandriva Java stack has been entirely rebuilt to version 8 and
   is completely functional.

   We currently provide Eclipse Luna by default.

Printing

   Improved support for printing, with an emphasis on the latest HP
   printers. Printing support is based on [118]Cups 2.0.3 and ghostscript
   9.18.

Sound

   [119]ALSA is updated to version 1.1.1

   Pulseaudio version is 8.0, you can find more information about features
   [120]here.

Multimedia

   The [121]SMPlayer media player is now included, using [122]MPV as its
   default backend. If you live in a country that allows it, you may want
   to install the various codecs from the restricted repository for
   improved codec support.

Cloud service

   We added support for owncloud.org via owncloudclient package.

LCMS

   We have updated our LCMS to version 2.x, also all software which was
   dependant on older library has been rebuilt to meet new one.

libarchive

   We have decided to make better use of [123]libarchive, and starting
   from this release by default we use:
     * bsdtar as a default tar program
     * bsdcpio as a default cpio program

   Detailed features and benefits can be found [124]here.

Perl

   Perl base package has been updated to 5.20.3 version. All perl related
   software in main repository has been rebuilt to meet new version.

Python

   Python has been updated to 3.4.4 version and starting from now it
   became default python interpreter over python 2.x.

Virtualization

   We are providing support for:
     * qemu
     * docker
     * virtualbox

   You can install and run these out of the box.

Games

   We are providing many games which has been ported to Linux. With use of
   [125]PlayOnLinux you can play games available only on Windows(tm)
   platform. Of course [126]Steam package is available and can be
   installed using urpmi, rpmdrake or plasma-discover.

   To give it a go, enable the non-free repositories, and
urpmi steam

   More information can be found on our page dedicated to [127]games.

ISO build tools

   Previously livecd-tools were used to build OpenMandriva ISO images. Due
   to code complication and its limits, we moved to build own ISO image
   build tool.

   [128]omdv-build-iso is written as a bash shell script, which works out
   of box on [129]ABF and in userland.

Upgrading to OpenMandriva Lx 3.0

   Upgrading between releases always has the potential to cause some
   problems. Upgrading is supported and we do test upgrades, but due to
   the huge range of packages and hardware configurations that are
   possible, the upgrade may cause unexpected problems. Therefore we
   recommend that you always perform fully backup your system prior to any
   upgrading attempt, since there can be a chance for a loss of data. In
   particular be aware that upgrading between MDV-based packages and
   OMV-based packages may be the most problematic and should be avoided if
   possible.

   We hope that upgrading between OpenMandriva Lx releases will become
   easier in the near future.

Upgrading from previous OpenMandriva Lx Releases

   If you do NOT receive an upgrade notification from the Online Update
   applet, you may have to update your system.

   If mdkapplet crashes trying to upgrade, you may have to update the
   packages on your system first.

   If you still do not receive a notification (we may not have pushed it
   to all systems) or wish to do a manual upgrade, you may step through
   the following procedure.

   As root, run the following commands:
urpmi.removemedia -a

urpmi.addmedia --distrib --mirrorlist 'http://downloads.openmandriva.org/mirrors
/openmandriva.3.0.ARCH.list'

   Substitute ARCH with your architecture, e.g. i586 or x86_64.

   Then run the following commands:
urpmi --auto --auto-select --replacefiles 2>&1 | tee /root/upgrade.log

   Reboot when completed. The upgrade log is stored in /root/upgrade.log.

Upgrading from 2011.0

   Please upgrade to 2013.0 first by following the procedures outlined in
   the [130]2013.0 release notes before upgrading to 3.0.

Changes to Hardware Support

Graphics Support

   Graphics support has improved with the latest drivers however there are
   still issues with some hardware.

NVIDIA Graphics Cards

   This release includes the reverse engineered nouveau driver, which
   gives moderately good support for most NVIDIA cards. For some
   dual-screen work it is actually better than NVIDIA's binary driver as
   it supports screen rotation on a second monitor, which is useful for
   monitors with rotatable screens.

   NVIDIA's binary drivers (which provide better performance and better
   support for the very latest NVIDIA GPUs) are currently supported by the
   XFDrake, the DrakX video configuration tool. In some cases it may be
   necessary to install older drivers using the command line. These
   drivers are available from the OpenMandriva repositories.

ATI Graphics Cards

   The latest ATI graphics cards are supported; however, we have not had
   any concrete feedback about its usage. Your mileage may vary.

   If you are using Radeon HD7770 or if you experience a black screen at
   boot and you know that you have an ATI/AMD grahics card please add the
   command below to the grub2 cmdline:-
xorg.blacklist=ati

   To do this at when booting the iso press the "TAB" key; the kernel
   bootline will be displayed at the bottom of the screen, go to the end
   of it and add any options required there. Press enter to boot. If you
   need to enter a kernel parameter while boot an installed system the
   procedure is slightly different. At the boot screen press the "E" key
   and this will bring up the Grub editor. Search for the first line that
   begins with "linux" go to the end of it and add the option there. To
   boot press F10.

Intel Graphics Chips

   Intel graphics chips are fully supported.

   For 6th generation Skylake GPUs, you should use kernel 4.6 or 4.7-rc
   instead of 4.1.18-nrjQL.

Miscellaneous Graphic Cards .

   We have not had feedback from users. Should you have an unusual
   graphics card that is not performing as it should please file a bug at
   issues.openmandriva.org

Laptops with dual graphics cards .

   Please report any issues experienced

Changes to Installation

Installer

   We are using [131]Calamares as our default installer.

   Calamares is an installer framework. By design it is very customizable,
   in order to satisfy a wide variety of needs and use cases.

   Calamares aims to be easy, usable, beautiful, pragmatic, inclusive and
   distribution-agnostic.

Unused Hardware & Language Removal

   This feature has been re-enabled. It prompts you to run it at first
   boot, and you may run it any time afterwards from the oma-welcome
   application (Welcome to OpenMandriva Lx).

Changes to the DrakX suite of tools

Boot Configuration

   We now default to using grub2-editor to control the boot loader.

Proprietary Drivers

   We now install proprietary drivers for nVIDIA and AMD correctly.

Firewall

   We have deprecated drakfirewall in favour of firewall-config, which
   relies on firewalld.

   Service responsible for firewall is enabled by default.

Booting with systemd

   Systemd has now been moved into the initramfs and the result is
   super-fast booting. Switching runlevels has changed. Instead of adding
   the target runlevel, as before, there are now specific boot options.
   Namely, the following options must be appended to the kernel command
   line:
     * Rescue Mode: systemd.unit=rescue.target
     * Text Mode: systemd.unit=multi-user.target
     * Graphical Mode: systemd.unit=graphical.target

Desktop Environments

   This BETA release offers KDE Plasma 5, LXQt and xfce4 as desktop
   environments.

Media Sources

main

   main is the core packages maintained by the OpenMandriva Lx team. This
   includes anything included in the install images as well as many more
   applications considered important.

contrib

   contrib represents community maintained packages. These are not
   supported by the core OpenMandriva Lx team, and depend on package
   maintainers to update it.

restricted

   restricted contains libraries that aren't installed by default due to
   legal concerns (such as patent issues). The usage of these packages
   vary by country - OpenMandriva Lx is not responsible for their usage!
   If you believe that their usage is disallowed in your country, please
   disable the restricted repositories.

non-free

   non-free contains applications and drivers that are distributable, but
   do not meet the definitions of [132]Free Software. While we can adjust
   the packaging of such applications, we do not have the source code and
   therefore can not fix problems caused by anything in this repository.

Other Changes

Monitor EDID Loading

   The "EDID override" feature is now available and allows a monitor with
   incorrect (or no) EDID to be enabled at kernel boot A package
   "edidbins" has been included in the ISOs which provided five binary
   files to support the most common resolutions. These may be called from
   the kernel command line at boot such that screen resolution may be
   force to that which the user desires. Obviously a facility like this
   should be used with care as it has the potential to damage your
   monitor. In order to enable one of the supplied edid's you need to add
   the following line to your kernel command line
   "drm_kms_helper.edid_firmware=edid/1280x1024.bin" obviously you can
   select your resolution from those supplied which are.

   1024x768 1280x1024 1600x1200 1680x1050 1920x1080

   As things currently stand these resolutions are available as soon as
   the root directory is mounted. If you want these resolutions for
   plymouth then you will need to incorporate the edid binary file in the
   initramfs. Dracut the image builder does not currently support this.
   The current approach would be to unpack the initramfs, add the
   necessary files and then repack.

Errata

   As with any release, there are still issues and bugs that may not have
   been resolved. This page documents those that may cause inconvenience
   and where possible details how they may be worked around.

Booting Live DVD/USB

   If you have a problem booting the live image with some hardware please
   report a bug detailing your hardware and any observations that you make
   if you are affected by this problem.
Partitioning with Small Disks

   When using the custom partitioning tool to divide up the hard disk/s be
   aware that there is a minimum size requirement a root partition that
   contains the /usr directory of at least 5.0Gb. If the partition is made
   smaller that this the partition manager will not function correctly.

   Due to the adoption of systemd the use of a separate /usr partition is
   no longer possible. It is still permissible to have a separate
   /usr/local partition.

   Workaround: If you receive an error message stating that the partition
   is smaller than the minimum requirement then do not try to resize it as
   this will fail; instead, use the auto-allocate function which will
   automatically create a partitioning scheme for you, which you may then
   delete or change to suit your own requirements. This will clear the
   error.

Local Network Sharing

   The firewall service, firewalld is now enabled by default, if required
   it may be disabled via the OMA Contol Centre under the system entry.
   Additionally to aid local networking both nfs and samba ports are open
   over and above the usual ssh and other services.

Parental Controls

   Parental Controls are currently non-functional.

   Workaround: None available at the moment.

Partitioning: General Information

   When using the custom partitioning tool to divide up the hard disk/s be
   aware that there is a minimum size requirement a root partition that
   contains the /usr directory of at least 5.0Gb. If the partition is made
   smaller that this the partition manager will not function correctly.

   Due to the adoption of systemd the use of a separate /usr partition is
   [133]no longer possible. It is still permissible to have a separate
   /usr/local partition.

Admin Privileges: The wheel group

   Please note that the first user created on the system is part of the
   wheel group, which allocates special privileges that are usually only
   allocated for the root user. Users in wheel can bypass certain password
   dialogues to change system settings.

   Workaround: This is intended behaviour. If you wish to disable this,
   remove users from the wheel group.

Black Screen at Boot

   There is an issue with some systems that have two different graphics
   adapters but only one of them is operational. Typically this is a
   Nvidia GPU combined the either Intel or AMD/ATI. Due to the automated
   nature of driver selection in modern systems if the non-functional GPU
   is automatically selected then X will load the matching driver. Thus
   the working GPU never gets setup resulting in a black screen. We have
   recently added a new boot command line option to allow an Xorg driver
   to be blacklisted thus allowing the correct driver to be detected.

   To use this feature you must edit the grub2 command line. You can do
   this by selecting your desired boot option and then pressing TAB. To
   the end of the line add the following:-
xorg.blacklist=<driver to blacklist>

   To determine which driver needs to be blacklisted is probably best
   achieved by booting the system to a text mode and checking which driver
   has been loaded at boot time. A procedure for doing this is detailed
   below. In some circumstances this may not be possible and you will need
   to resort to your motherboard/Graphics card specifications or trial and
   error. It will be necessary to permanently add the line to the grub2
   command line that boots the installation. This is described below.

   There are other circumstances where a black screen may be encountered.
   For example if you wish to use the proprietary driver for your graphics
   adapter it may be necessary to inhibit the kernel mechanism that loads
   the free drivers. In these circumstances adding
nomodeset

   or
nokmsboot

   to the kernel command line will normally be enough to allow
   installation of the OS or running with the manufacturers drivers . If
   necessary the command may be added permanently by editing
   /etc/default/grub at the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT label and adding
   the required command. Then run update-grub2

   If you are using the internal GPU of an Intel Skylake processor, you
   should use kernel 4.5 (rather than 4.1.18-nrjQL) and/or specify
i915.preliminary_hw_support=1

   on the kernel command line.

   To boot to text mode:-

   1: Boot from the DVD/USB stick and at the grub selection screen select
   the livecd option and press TAB. Edit the grub command line by and add
   the command
"systemd.unit=multi-user.task nomodeset"

   to the end and boot the machine. This will bring you to a command
   prompt where you can login.

   2: Login as root and then type lsmod | less and observe the output.
   Look for the loaded graphics driver by finding the drm entry the
   graphics driver will be listed here. It will be typically nouveau,
   radeon or i915 (there may be others). The name used here will be the
   name to add to the xorg.blacklist= parameter

Other Graphical Boot Issues

   ATI There are a number of graphical boot issues which may result in a
   black screen or a low resolution graphics screen. The ATI X600 based
   adapters currently suffer from a segfault in the driver making
   graphical boot impossible this may extend extend to other ATI based
   hardware which we have not tested. We recommend installing the fglrx
   drivers in text mode you may have to compile these manually until
   updates to the dkms package are available. Intel Users with older
   motherboard based Intel graphics hardware which may find issues when
   trying to use alternative graphics hardware. It is known that nVidia
   hardware does not start up properly in this configuration. Usually the
   result is a black screen. There are a number of things that can be
   tried but the best combination so far is to disable the Intel card from
   the command line using "i915.disable_display=true" and pre-loading the
   nouveau driver with "rd.driver.pre=nouveau" and adding "nomodeset".
   This may give a low res graphical screen. If you do no get a graphical
   screen use all the above options and boot into text mode (see above)
   buy adding systemd.unit=multi-user.target to the end of the grub boot
   line. Once in text mode as root add the nouveau driver to
   /etc/modprobe.preload.d/modprobe-preload.conf. You will still need
   "i915.disable_display=true" and "nomodeset" on the grub command line
   but this should give a graphical boot but still at low res. Hopefully
   updates will bring a resolution to this problem.

Backlight Issues

   There are some machines with Intel GPU's (Netbooks particularly) that
   may still give a black screen even with everything set up correctly;
   this is due to the screen backlight logic being inverted. This may be
   fixed by adding i915.invert_brightness=1 parameter to the boot command
   line. This may be needed in addition to the xorg.blacklist= parameter.

Boot to a dracut prompt

   If this happens all is not lost. This may be indicative of the lack of
   disk driver for your hardware. Dracut indicates that it has produced a
   bug report which you can copy to a memory stick and then attach to a
   bug report you will need to mount your memory stick. Assuming it is FAT
   formatted then plug it in and type 'dmesg' the device name of your
   memory stick should be visible it will be in the form /dev/sd<x> the
   bracketed x will vary depending on how many drives have been found on
   your machine if for example you have one other drive then the entry
   might read /dev/sdb. Create a new directory /mnt with 'mkdir /mnt' then
   type 'mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt' and the drive should be mounted.
   (Note the 1 added to the device name). You should then be able to copy
   files to your memory stick with 'cp <files> /mnt/' . Please take the
   trouble to report this type of problem as receiving these reports is
   the only way we can improve our distribution.

Calamares Installer

   On some systems the standalone versions of Calamares do not start; if
   you experience this issue please report a bug. The problem does not
   seem to occur if Calamares is launched from the live system. Also
   please note that the selections for disk and bootloader installation
   are not sticky. If the screen is re-written they will return to the
   defaults. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next released
   iso.

   UEFI Installs

   The Calamares installer supports EFI installs but not secure boot. If
   your system has an existing fat32 partition that is under 330MB
   Calamares will give and error message and warn that installation might
   fail. The reason for this is that the theoretical minimum size for
   creating a FAT32 partition is around 330Mb. If you wish to keep your
   existing partion then mark it FAT16 instead and the error message will
   go away and the install and boot proceed normally. Alternatively you
   can increase the size of the partition to >330Mb and the install should
   proceed normally with FAT32 selected as the filesystem.

   Dual Installs (EFI and BIOS booting on the same disk) and BIOS install
   on GPT partitioned disks.

   Please be aware that if you wish to perform a BIOS install on a GPT
   formatted disk you must ensure that the disk contains a small partition
   => 2Mb for grub to install the bootloader into. This partition can be
   located before or after the EFI partition. It does not need to be
   formatted but must have the "bios-grub" flag set.
