2013.0 Beta

   The OpenMandriva Cooker & QA teams are pleased to announce the
   availability of the 2013.0 beta!

   Detailed are some of the changes that the OS has undergone since
   Mandriva Linux 2012.

   This is a beta, not for use in production environments. It has received
   some testing and is believed to be stable. However there are still some
   bugs. You have been warned.

   You may wish to view the Errata, located near the bottom of this page.

Available Media

   The 2013.0 beta is available as a live media DVD, downloadable in ISO
   format. They are available on our downloads page.

   Live media means you're able to run OpenMandriva LX straight from the
   DVD and try it before installing it. You may also install the system to
   hard disk either from the running live cd or from the boot manager.

Recommended Hardware

   Please note the recommended hardware requirements have changed; To run
   the distribution, we recommend 1 GB of memory (min 640MB), at least 10
   GB of hard drive space (see below for known issues with partitioning),
   and for best compositing performance a suitable accelerated 3D graphics
   card. Releases are available for the i586 and x86_64 architectures.

New Features and Major Changes

   The introduction of OpenMandriva-2013.0 represents a major update from
   the previous version of Mandriva. This is the first release under the
   new name, OpenMandriva LX, and is also the first release under the
   community of the OpenMandriva Association. With that in mind, here are
   some of the new features:

KDE 4.11

   KDE 4.11 provides a clean, unified desktop for OpenMandriva. It has all
   the tools required to be productive whilst providing a pleasant,
   functional environment.

   This beta provides a KDE 4.11 installation with four launchers:
   Lancelot, the traditional KDE KickOff/KMenu, ROSA's SimpleWelcome, and
   the Homerun Launcher. We'd like feedback on which should be the default
   in the 2013.0 final release, so please be sure to voice your thoughts
   on the OpenMandriva forums at http://forums.openmandriva.org/!

Upgrading to 2013.0

   Upgrading between releases of OpenMandriva always has the potential to
   cause some problems. Upgrading is supported and we do test upgrades,
   but due to the huge range of packages and hardware configurations
   possible, it is always the case that in your particular situation, the
   upgrade may cause a problem we did not anticipate. Therefore we
   recommend that you always back up your system prior to upgrading.

   In particular, upgrading between MDV-based packages and OMV-based
   packages may cause problems.

Upgrading from 2011.0

   We do not currently have an official way to update this from the GUI,
   as our tool is not ready yet.

   With the caveats mentioned above, you can still accomplish this upgrade
   from the command line. To do this, first ensure your system is entirely
   up-to-date with the latest updates for your current version of the
   distribution (using either MandrivaUpdate, Mandriva Online (Mandriva
   update notification applet) or urpmi --auto-update}}.

   Then remove your existing repositories, either using the graphical
   repository configuration tool or the urpmi.removemedia command.
   urpmi.removemedia -a will remove all repositories. Then you should add
   repositories for this release. Run a command like this:
urpmi.addmedia --distrib --mirrorlist 'http://downloads.openmandriva.org/mirrors
/openmandriva.2013.0.ARCH.list'

   Substitute ARCH with your architecture, e.g. i586 or x86_64.

   Then run the following commands, as root:
urpmi --auto --auto-select --replacefiles 2>&1 | tee upgrade.log

   You may see an error "unknown option --replacefiles" when you first run
   this, but don't worry, that's normal: older urpmi versions do not have
   this option, but our urpmi does, and it will be passed along to our
   urpmi when the urpmi process is restarted after the package has been
   updated. This will save the output of the process to the file
   upgrade.log, in case you need to check it later, or you have any
   problems. Once the process completes, you should reboot immediately,
   and you should find the system has been fully updated to this version.

Unavailable

DrakX Installer

   The DrakX Installer is not included in this release. We hope to include
   it in later releases.

Changes to Hardware Support

Graphics Support

   Graphics support has improved with the latest drivers.

NVIDIA Graphics Cards

   Note that older NVidia graphics cards FX series and before are not
   currently supported by the drakx Xorg configuration tool, this is
   currently under investigation. Older drivers are available from the
   OpenMandriva repositories and should be installed directly with urpmi:
   your mileage may vary. The reverse engineered nouveau driver gives
   moderately good support for these older cards.

ATI Graphics Cards

   The latest ATI graphics cards are supported; however, we have not had
   any concrete feedback about its usage. Your mileage may vary.

Intel Graphics Cards

   Intel graphics cards should be supported with the latest kernel we
   have, including newer 4th generation Intel graphics cards.

Misc.

   We have not had any other feedback from users.

Ethernet Support

   The kernel upgrade to 3.10.9 has enabled much more support, including
   new ethernet drivers and improved existing drivers, such as Atheros
   ethernet chips (alx).

Changes with Installation

Unused Hardware & Language Removal

   Previously, when running the installer, you would not be prompted to
   remove any hardware or languages that the system did not use. However,
   this did lead to numerous false-positives (and even in some cases,
   destruction of the installed system). We have disabled the removal step
   until the problem can be remedied or a choice given to the user
   (unselected by default).

Errata

   As this is a beta, there are still issues and bugs that have not been
   resolved. This page attempts to document the ones that may cause
   inconvenience.

Partitioning

   When using the custom partitioning tool to divide up the hard disk/s be
   aware that there is a minimum size requirement for the partition that
   contains the /usr directory of at least 4.0Gb. If the partition is made
   smaller that this the partition manager will not function correctly.

   Workaround: If you receive an error message stating that the partition
   is smaller than the minimum requirement then do not try to resize it as
   this will fail; instead, use the auto-allocate function which will
   automatically create a partitioning scheme for you, which you may then
   delete or change to suit your own requirements. This will clear the
   error.

Printing with HP USB Printers

   There is currently a known communication error between OpenMandriva LX
   and HP printers connected via USB. Anything sent to print will fail as
   a "device communication error".

   Workaround: Sadly, there is none at this current time. This is planned
   to be addressed in a future update.
