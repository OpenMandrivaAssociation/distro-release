   The OpenMandriva Lx teams are pleased to announce the availability of
   the 2013.0 final release!

   Detailed are some of the changes that the OS has undergone since
   Mandriva Linux 2011.

Available Media

   This release is available as a live media DVD, downloadable in ISO
   format. They are available on our downloads page.

   Live media means you're able to run OpenMandriva Lx straight from the
   DVD and try it before installing it. You may also install the system to
   hard disk either from the running live cd or from the boot manager.

Recommended Hardware

   Please note the recommended hardware requirements have changed; To run
   the distribution, we recommend 1 GB of memory (min 640MB), at least 10
   GB of hard drive space (see below for known issues with partitioning),
   and for best compositing performance a suitable accelerated 3D graphics
   card. Releases are available for the i586 and x86_64 architectures. ARM
   architectures are not available for this release.

Booting from USB

   It is possible to boot this release from a USB. You may use
   [44]Fedora's LiveUSB Creator with a download of the OpenMandriva Lx ISO
   for your system to make your USB bootable. At least 2GB of flash drive
   capacity is recommended. Persistent storage is not necessary. Note that
   this will erase everything on your USB! It is also possible to use the
   dd command to image the iso to an USB Drive e.g "dd if=<iso_name>
   of=/dev/sd<x> bs=4M" .

Booting with KVM

   Please use the QXL or VMWare video driver to avoid any problems booting
   OpenMandriva LX with kernel 3.11.5 or higher.

Booting with VirtualBox

   Please note that there is an increased memory requirement for
   successful booting in this VM manager. The virtual machine should be
   set up with a minumum of 1536mb.

New Features and Major Changes

   The introduction of OpenMandriva 2013.0 represents a major update from
   the previous version of Mandriva. This is the first release under the
   new name, OpenMandriva Lx, and is also the first release under the
   community of the OpenMandriva Association. With that in mind, here are
   some of the new features:

Kernel

   OpenMandriva Lx features new kernel called NRJ as for energy!

   With the "NRJ" configs the CPU and RCU are configured with full
   Preemption enabled and in full Boost mode, while the "QL" mode add also
   the CK1 and BFQ patchsets combined provide optimisations, including
   better CPU load scheduler (BFS), better disk I/O scheduler (BFQ), then
   we must consider the presence of UKSM for a better memory manager and
   TOI for better suspension and hibernate functionality, each designed
   with desktop system performance and responsiveness in mind

KDE 4.11.2

   KDE 4.11.2 provides a clean, unified desktop for OpenMandriva. It has
   all the tools required to be productive whilst providing a pleasant,
   functional environment.

   This release provides a KDE 4.11 installation featuring ROSA's
   SimpleWelcome launcher, a winner of the latest contest.

Upgrading to 2013.0

   Upgrading between releases of Mandriva always has the potential to
   cause some problems. Upgrading is supported and we do test upgrades,
   but due to the huge range of packages and hardware configurations
   possible, it is always the case that in your particular situation, the
   upgrade may cause a problem we did not anticipate. Therefore we
   recommend that you always back up your system prior to upgrading.

   Upgrading between OpenMandriva releases should be less problematic in
   the future.

   In particular, upgrading between MDV-based packages and OMV-based
   packages may cause problems.

Upgrading from 2011.0

   We do not currently have an official way to update this from the GUI,
   as our tool is not ready yet.

   With the caveats mentioned above, you can still accomplish this upgrade
   from the command line. To do this, first ensure your system is entirely
   up-to-date with the latest updates for your current version of the
   distribution (using either MandrivaUpdate, Mandriva Online (Mandriva
   update notification applet) or urpmi --auto-update}}.

   Then remove your existing repositories, either using the graphical
   repository configuration tool or the urpmi.removemedia command.
   urpmi.removemedia -a will remove all repositories. Then you should add
   repositories for this release. Run a command like this:
urpmi.addmedia --distrib --mirrorlist 'http://downloads.openmandriva.org/mirrors
/openmandriva.2013.0.ARCH.list'

   Substitute ARCH with your architecture, e.g. i586 or x86_64.

   Then run the following commands, as root:
urpmi --auto --auto-select --replacefiles 2>&1 | tee upgrade.log

   You may see an error "unknown option --replacefiles" when you first run
   this, but don't worry, that's normal: older urpmi versions do not have
   this option, but our urpmi does, and it will be passed along to our
   urpmi when the urpmi process is restarted after the package has been
   updated. This will save the output of the process to the file
   upgrade.log, in case you need to check it later, or you have any
   problems. Once the process completes, you should reboot immediately,
   and you should find the system has been fully updated to this version.

Unavailable

DrakX Installer

   The DrakX Installer is not included in this release. We hope to include
   it (or a new installer that brings back its features) in later
   releases.

Changes to Hardware Support

Graphics Support

   Graphics support has improved with the latest drivers.

NVIDIA Graphics Cards

   Note that older NVidia graphics cards FX series and before are not
   currently supported by the XFDrake, the DrakX video configuration tool.
   Older drivers are available from the OpenMandriva repositories and
   should be installed directly with urpmi: your mileage may vary. The
   reverse engineered nouveau driver gives moderately good support for
   these older cards.

ATI Graphics Cards

   The latest ATI graphics cards are supported; however, we have not had
   any concrete feedback about its usage. Your mileage may vary.

Intel Graphics Cards

   Intel graphics cards are supported with the latest kernel we have,
   including newer 4th generation Intel graphics cards.

Misc.

   We have not had any other feedback from users.

Ethernet Support

   The kernel upgrade to 3.11.5 has enabled much more support, including
   new ethernet drivers and improved existing drivers, such as Atheros
   ethernet chips (alx).

Changes to Installation

Unused Hardware & Language Removal

   Previously, when running the installer, you would not be prompted to
   remove any hardware or languages that the system did not use. However,
   this did lead to numerous false-positives (and even in some cases,
   destruction of the installed system). We have disabled the removal step
   until the problem can be remedied or a choice given to the user
   (unselected by default).

Changes to the DrakX suite of tools

   N/A

Changes to Software Support

Booting with systemd

   Switching runlevels has changed. Instead of adding the target runlevel,
   as before, there are now specific boot options. Namely, the following
   options must be appended to the kernel command line:
     * Rescue Mode: systemd.unit=rescue.target
     * Text Mode: systemd.unit=multi-user.target
     * Graphical Mode: systemd.unit=graphical.target

VirtualBox

   We include VirtualBox 4.3 and above. Please note of an issue with
   VirtualBox Guest Additions in versions less than 4.3 and our kernels in
   the errata.

Other Changes

   N/A

Errata

   As with any release, there are still issues and bugs that have not been
   resolved. This page attempts to document the ones that may cause
   inconvenience.

Update tool tries to add Cooker repositories

   The update tool, MandrivaUpdate, will attempt to add repositories that
   are not for 2013.0; instead, it will try to add Cooker repositories and
   expose your system to unnecessary and potentially breakable updates.

   Workaround: Either use the popup that appears with mdkapplet; or:
   Open Install & Remove Software (or rpmdrake), and from the menu, open
   the Media Manager and click Add. This will add the proper repositories.
   Then, check periodically for updates. MandrivaUpdate will be usable
   after this workaround.

Usage of Mandriva in System Tools

   There are still usages of Mandriva in the system tools. They are being
   remedied.

   Workaround: Check for updates periodically, and report bugs for any
   occurrences that you still see.

Partitioning with Small Disks

   When using the custom partitioning tool to divide up the hard disk/s be
   aware that there is a minimum size requirement for the partition that
   contains the /usr directory of at least 4.0Gb. If the partition is made
   smaller that this the partition manager will not function correctly.

   Workaround: If you receive an error message stating that the partition
   is smaller than the minimum requirement then do not try to resize it as
   this will fail; instead, use the auto-allocate function which will
   automatically create a partitioning scheme for you, which you may then
   delete or change to suit your own requirements. This will clear the
   error.

VirtualBox Guest Additions

   Due to a recent API change, 4.2.x series of vboxadditions will not
   work. Instead, use 4.3.x series which is known to work with this
   release [45]Bug small.png [46]Bug #204

   Workaround: Upgrade to VirtualBox 4.3 or later.

Black Screen at Boot

   Graphics Drivers:

   There is an issue with systems that have two different graphics
   adapters but only one of them is operational. Typically this is a
   Nvidia GPU combined the either Intel or AMD/ATI. Due to the automated
   nature of driver selection in modern systems if the non-functional GPU
   is automatically selected then X will load the matching driver. Thus
   the working GPU never gets setup resulting in a black screen. We have
   recently added a new boot command line option to allow an Xorg driver
   to be blacklisted thus allowing the correct driver to be detected.

   To use this feature you must edit the grub2 command line. You can do
   this by selecting your desired boot option and then pressing TAB. To
   the end of the line add the following:-

   xorg.blacklist=<driver to blacklist>.

   To determine which driver needs to be blacklisted is probably best
   achieved by booting the system to a text mode and checking which driver
   has been loaded at boot time. A procedure for doing this is detailed
   below. In some circumstances this may not be possible and you will need
   to resort to your motherboard/Graphics card specifications or trial and
   error. It will be necessary to permanently add the line to the grub2
   commandline that boots the installation. This is described below.

   There are other circumstances where a black screen may be encountered.
   In these circumstances adding nomodeset or nokmsboot to the kernel
   commandline will normally be enough to allow installation of the OS. If
   necessary the command may be added permanently by editing
   /etc/default/grub at the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT label and adding
   the required command. Then run update-grub2

   To boot to text mode:-

   1: Boot from the DVD/USB stick and at the grub selection screen select
   the livecd option and press TAB. Edit the grub command line by and add
   the command "systemd.unit=multi-user.task nomodeset" to the end and
   boot the machine. This will bring you to a command prompt where you can
   login.

   2: Login as root and then type lsmod | less and observe the output.
   Look for the loaded graphics driver by finding the drm entry the
   graphics driver will be listed here. It will be typically nouveau,
   radeon or i915 (there may be others). The name used here will be the
   name to add to the xorg.blacklist= parameter

   Backlight Issues

   There are some machines with Intel GPU's (Netbooks particularly) may
   still give a black screen. This may be fixed by adding
   i915.invert_brightness=1 parameter to the boot command line. This may
   be needed in addition to the xorg.blacklist= parameter.
