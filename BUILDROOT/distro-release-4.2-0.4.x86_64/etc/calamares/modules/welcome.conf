# GeoIP checking
#
# This can be used to pre-select a language based on the country
# the user is currently in. It *assumes* that there's internet
# connectivity, though. Configuration is like in the locale module,
# but remember to use a URL that returns full data **and** to
# use a selector that will pick the country, not the timezone.
#
# To disable GeoIP checking, either comment-out the entire geoip section,
# or set the *style* key to an unsupported format (e.g. `none`).
# Also, note the analogous feature in src/modules/locale/locale.conf.
#
geoip:
    style:    "none"
    url:      "https://geoip.kde.org/v1/ubiquity"  # extended XML format
    selector: "CountryCode"  # blank uses default, which is wrong

# User interface
#
# The "select language" icon is an international standard, but it
# might not theme very well with your desktop environment.
# Fill in an icon name (following FreeDesktop standards) to
# use that named icon instead of the usual one.
#
# Leave blank or unset to use the international standard.
#
# Known icons in this space are "set-language" and "config-language".
#
# languageIcon: set-language
